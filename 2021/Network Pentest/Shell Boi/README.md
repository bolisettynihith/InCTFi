He sells linux shells on the shell store.


### **Short writeup**

+ There are 2 hosts in the network 172.30.0.5 and 172.30.0.8.
+ Since this is a multi host environment, there are possibilities of MiTM attacks.
+ Perform an MiTM attack using tools like ettercap, you'll see that host A is sending IP and port details to host B, then host B sends reverse shell over that port.
+ Now modify the IP and port to your local port and IP to get a reverse shell.
