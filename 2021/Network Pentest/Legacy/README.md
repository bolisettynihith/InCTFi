## **Legacy**

### **Challenge description**

There's no guarantee, it's not up to me, you can only see.

### **Short writeup**

+ There is a web server which uses legacy debug bridge api for users identified as admins.
+ To get identified as admin, set a referer header as shown in the html page and send the debug request to the v1 api with bash commands to get RCE as `www-data` user.
+ Now, for privilege escalation - there is a cronjob running as root which tries lo load env variables from a file in www-data's scope and executes zcat.
+ Create a fake zcat with reverse shell payload in the path variable set by you using the env file. Now wait for root to execute that with cron.
